## Heterogeneous AI Distributed Inference System (HADIS)

### üí° Project Overview
This Git Organization has been established to develop distributed inference and model optimization technologies for large-scale AI models in heterogeneous AI semiconductor environments. Our goal is to maximize the performance and power efficiency of AI services by effectively utilizing various types of AI semiconductors (GPUs, NPUs, etc.).

### üöÄ Goals & Core Values
* Performance Optimization: Optimize inference speed and throughput of AI models in heterogeneous AI semiconductor environments.
* Power Efficiency Enhancement: Minimize the energy consumption of AI services to improve performance per watt.
* Hardware Utilization Maximization: Develop technologies that comprehensively leverage the strengths of AI semiconductors with different characteristics.
* Open Source Ecosystem Contribution: Contribute to the advancement of the field by open-sourcing the developed technologies.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Development Areas
This project focuses on the development of the following core technologies:

* Distributed Inference Framework for Heterogeneous AI Semiconductors:
  * Efficient task distribution and synchronization technologies among diverse AI semiconductors.
  * Optimized data communication and batching strategies.
* Model Optimization Technologies:
  * Model lightweighting techniques such as Quantization and Pruning, optimized for heterogeneous semiconductor environments.
  * Model compilation and deployment pipelines tailored to specific semiconductor characteristics.
* Performance & Power Consumption Measurement/Evaluation Tools:
  * Tools for quantitatively measuring and validating the performance (inference speed, throughput) and power consumption/efficiency of the developed technologies.

### üéØ Technological Necessity (Problem Statement & Solution)
Existing AI services often face limitations in scalability and power efficiency due to their reliance on specific hardware (primarily GPUs).
